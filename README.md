# Weather

Automated weather market trading and research system for Polymarket. It starts from the original `weatherbot` prototype and is being refactored into a modular Python package with typed models, tests, and a clearer separation between forecasting, strategy, storage, and execution.

Current compatibility entrypoint:

```bash
python weatherbet.py
```

## Versions

### `bot_v1.py` — Base Bot
The foundation. Scans 6 US cities, fetches forecasts from NWS using airport station coordinates, finds matching temperature buckets on Polymarket, and enters trades when the market price is below the entry threshold.

No math, no complexity. Just the core logic — good for understanding how the system works.

### `weatherbet.py` — Compatibility Entrypoint
Everything in v1, plus:
- **20 cities** across 4 continents (US, Europe, Asia, South America, Oceania)
- **3 forecast sources** — ECMWF (global), HRRR/GFS (US, hourly), METAR (real-time observations)
- **Expected Value** — skips trades where the math doesn't work
- **Kelly Criterion** — sizes positions based on edge strength
- **Stop-loss + trailing stop** — 20% stop, moves to breakeven at +20%
- **Slippage filter** — skips markets with spread > $0.03
- **Self-calibration** — learns forecast accuracy per city over time
- **Full data storage** — every forecast snapshot, trade, and resolution saved to JSON

## How It Works

Polymarket runs markets like "Will the highest temperature in Chicago be between 46–47°F on March 7?" These markets are often mispriced — the forecast says 78% likely but the market is trading at 8 cents.

The bot:
1. Fetches forecasts from ECMWF and HRRR via Open-Meteo (free, no key required)
2. Gets real-time observations from METAR airport stations
3. Finds the matching temperature bucket on Polymarket
4. Calculates Expected Value — only enters if the math is positive
5. Sizes the position using fractional Kelly Criterion
6. Monitors stops every 10 minutes, full scan every hour
7. Auto-resolves markets by querying Polymarket API directly

## Why Airport Coordinates Matter

Most bots use city center coordinates. That's wrong.

Every Polymarket weather market resolves on a specific airport station. NYC resolves on LaGuardia (KLGA), Dallas on Love Field (KDAL) — not DFW. The difference between city center and airport can be 3–8°F. On markets with 1–2°F buckets, that's the difference between the right trade and a guaranteed loss.

| City | Station | Airport |
|------|---------|---------|
| NYC | KLGA | LaGuardia |
| Chicago | KORD | O'Hare |
| Miami | KMIA | Miami Intl |
| Dallas | KDAL | Love Field |
| Seattle | KSEA | Sea-Tac |
| Atlanta | KATL | Hartsfield |
| London | EGLC | London City |
| Tokyo | RJTT | Haneda |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasperclaw-v/weather
cd weather
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `config.json` in the project folder:
```json
{
  "balance": 10000.0,
  "max_bet": 20.0,
  "min_ev": 0.05,
  "max_price": 0.45,
  "min_volume": 2000,
  "min_hours": 2.0,
  "max_hours": 72.0,
  "kelly_fraction": 0.25,
  "max_slippage": 0.03,
  "scan_interval": 3600,
  "calibration_min": 30,
  "vc_key": "YOUR_VISUAL_CROSSING_KEY"
}
```

Use a Visual Crossing API key only if you want historical actual-temperature lookup for resolved markets. Do not commit secrets in `config.json`.

## Usage
```bash
python weatherbet.py           # start the bot
python weatherbet.py status    # balance and open positions
python weatherbet.py report    # full breakdown of resolved markets
python weatherbet.py scan      # isolated live paper scan, JSON output
python -m weather.cli.main     # equivalent package entrypoint
python3 -m streamlit run weather/ui/dashboard.py  # monitoring dashboard
```

---

## Data Storage

All data is saved to `data/markets/` — one JSON file per market. Each file contains:
- Hourly forecast snapshots (ECMWF, HRRR, METAR)
- Market price history
- Position details (entry, stop, PnL)
- Final resolution outcome

This data is used for self-calibration. The refactor also adds package modules under `weather/` and tests under `tests/`.

## APIs Used

| API | Auth | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| Open-Meteo | None | ECMWF + HRRR forecasts |
| Aviation Weather (METAR) | None | Real-time station observations |
| Polymarket Gamma | None | Market data |
| Visual Crossing | Free key | Historical temps for resolution |
